# Enter Rule UI

In the current version, only file object protection rules support custom scripts. To access the script editing interface, navigate to the "Resource Protection" tab and enter the "Create Rule" page.

In the "Path & Action" section, you will find a radio button labeled "Call custom script to decide on access." To enable this option, set the "Action" dropdown menu to "Protect".

Once you check the "Call custom script to decide on access" option, a button will appear on the right side of the interface, as shown in Figure 1. Clicking it will open a pop-up window similar to Figure 2, where you can input your script.

After configuring the other settings and saving the rule, the script will take effect.
