# Start with your init function

Since MP is still in its Beta testing phase, the name of the script's entry function is currently confusing. It uses the function name `TestAccess`.

You can define it as follows:

```javascript
function TestAccess(event) {
    return true;
}
```

The `event` object contains the following member variables:

* `event.NtPath` — The NT path of the resource
* `event.DosPath` — The DOS path of the resource
* `event.ActorPid` — The PID of the process accessing the resource
* `event.ActorServiceTag` — The service tag of the process accessing the resource
* `event.AccessMask` — The access mask of the access request (e.g., Read, Write, Read & Write)

### Notes

* `event.NtPath` and `event.DosPath` are strings. You can use string functions like `.includes()` to check conditions.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  event.NtPath.includes("\\Device\\HarddiskVolume1\\SensitiveFolder")
  ```

* `event.ActorPid` is an integer.

* `event.ActorServiceTag` and `event.AccessMask` are currently not publicly documented.

You can use compound conditional statements, such as `if`, as allowed by the JavaScript (V8) specification.
When the initial function returns `true`, the access request is allowed. Otherwise, the resource access request is denied.
