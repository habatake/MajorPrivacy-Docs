# Overview

In the current version of MajorPrivacy, the "Overview" panel is the default panel users are taken to after first installing MP (short for MajorPrivacy, hereinafter referred to as MP).

This panel typically consists entirely of a list box whose content users cannot modify. It contains log information from MP's own components and other sources.

For the next panel see "Process Security".
